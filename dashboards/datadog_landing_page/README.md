# Landing page - Welcome to Datadog

The Datadog organization landing page is the first page your users see when they log on to Datadog or navigate to the Datadog root page. Datadog sets a default landing page for your organization.
As an alternative to the default page, Datadog allows administrators to set a dashboard as the landing page for the organization.

The following custom landing page provides a guided experience for customers/teams who are onboarding in Datadog.
