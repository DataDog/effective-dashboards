# Effective Dashboards
Datadog is a complete platform that ingest all your observability and security telemetry data and allows to correlate them to help finding the root cause of potential issues.

Dashboards allow to have visualizations that help finding those correlations, but dashboards need to be carefully designed to make them as effective as possible.

Datadog maintains a set of out of the box dashboards for the different integrations. These dashboards are available from the Dashboards menu once an integration has been enabled. If you want to contribute a dashboard to an existing Datadog integration, follow [the integration dashboard best practices documentation.

This repository aims to collect and document general dashboard design best practices as well as maintaining a curated repository of well designed and reusable dashboards that don't fit in one of the integrations. If you want to contribute one of your dashboards to this repository, follow the contributing guidelines.
