# Contribution guidelines

## Contributing to the collection of dashboards

### Contributing with a new dashboard

The [dashboards](/dashboards/) folder contain a list of curated _effective_ dashboards contributed by the Datadog community. These are dashboards that are easy to customize and provide a cool use case for dashboards that the community wants to share.

This dashboards collection is curated by the maintainers of this repository. Contributions to the collection will be reviewed and will be accepted only if the maintainers consider that the dashboard follows the quality guidelines.

If you want to contribute to a new dashboard to this repository:

1. First, open an issue explaining the goal of the dashboard. We want to make sure that the dashboard fits on this repository before doing all the work. In some cases, instead of contributing to this repository, it will make sense to contribute the dashboard as an OOTB integration dashboard.
1. Make a copy of the [dashboard template folder](/dashboards/dashboard_template/).
1. Fill the [README.md](/dashboards/dashboard_template/README.md) with the dashboard details.
1. [Export your dashboard as JSON](https://docs.datadoghq.com/dashboards/#copy-import-or-export-dashboard-json) and include the JSON file in your dashboard folder.
1. Open a PR to this repository
